This folder holds screenshots and demo media for the `README.md`.

Place final images/GIFs here and commit them. Recommended filenames (these are referenced in the README):

- `screenshot-calendar.png`  (1024x600 recommended)
- `screenshot-list.png`      (1024x600 recommended)
- `demo.gif`                (max ~5-8s, small file)

How to add screenshots:
1. Run the app locally and capture the calendar view and the list view.
2. Optimize images (PNG or JPG) and place them in this folder.
3. Replace the placeholder images in the README or commit them with the same filenames.

Note: Do NOT commit any sensitive files into this folder. Add uploads to `.gitignore` if you add user-uploaded content.
